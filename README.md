# Temperature-controller-system

## Overview
This repository provides access to the experimental data and MATLAB scripts used in the temperature control system project, guided by Professor Sayantan Chakraborty at Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata. The repository includes scripts for plotting and analyzing data of various control strategies (ON-OFF, P, PI, PID) and plots for each method. Additionally, it stores the open loop response data, system transfer function parameters, and necessary helper functions.

## Repository Contents

### Experimental Data
The repository contains several `.xlsx` files, each corresponding to a different control strategy, along with the system’s open-loop response data. These files include the recorded temperature and time values for the respective experiments.

####  Open-Loop Response Data
- `open-loop-response-data.xlsx` - Contains time and temperature data for the system’s open-loop response.

#### Control Strategy Data
- `on-off-control-high-hyst-data.xlsx` - Data for ON-OFF control with high hysteresis.
- `on-off-control-low-hyst-data.xlsx` - Data for ON-OFF control with low hysteresis.
- `p-control-data.xlsx` - Data for proportional (P) control.
- `pi-control-data.xlsx` - Data for proportional-integral (PI) control.
- `pid-control-data.xlsx` - Data for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control.

### MATLAB Scripts
MATLAB scripts are included for analyzing the system response, generating plots, and determining the system’s transfer function parameters:

- `open_loop_script.m` - Computes the open-loop response and determines system parameters (gain, delay time, and time constant).
- `findInflect.m` - A helper function used to find the inflection point in the system's open-loop response.
- `on_off_control_script.m` - Plots system response of ON-OFF control with hysteresis.
- `P_control_script.m` - Calculates parameters of controller for P control according to Ziegler-Nichols tuning rule and plots system response.
- `PI_control_script.m` - Calculates parameters and plots system response for PI control according to Ziegler-Nichols tuning rule.
- `PID_control_script.m` - Calculates parameters and plots system response for PID control according to Ziegler-Nichols tuning rule.

### System Parameters
The system’s transfer function parameters, including gain, delay time, and time constant, are stored in the file `system_tf_parameters.txt`, which is generated by `open_loop_script.m`.

### Plots
Each control method and the open-loop response have corresponding `.png` files to visually represent the system's behavior:

- `open-loop-response-plot.png` - Visual representation of the open-loop system response.
- `on-off-control-high-hysteresis-plot.png` - Plot for ON-OFF control with high hysteresis.
- `on-off-control-low-hysteresis-plot.png` - Plot for ON-OFF control with low hysteresis.
- `p-control-response.png` - Plot for P control.
- `pi-control-response.png` - Plot for PI control.
- `pid-control-response.png` - Plot for PID control.

## Usage
The data files can be directly imported into MATLAB or other analysis tools. MATLAB users can run the scripts provided to analyze data and visualize the results.
